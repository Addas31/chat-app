## ▶️ How to Run the Project Locally

### Backend Setup
```
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

Backend runs on:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

### Frontend Setup
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🌐 Multi-Device Testing

To access the app from another laptop or mobile:

```
npm run dev -- --host
```

- Ensure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Open the Network URL shown in the terminal on other devices

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The frontend establishes a persistent WebSocket connection with the backend.
- When a user sends a message, it is emitted to the server.
- The server broadcasts the message to all connected clients instantly.
- This enables real-time communication without page refresh.
